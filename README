DESCRIPTION
    Simple module to check things happened recently. Uses DateTimeX::Easy
    and Time::Duration::Parse do parse the times and durations.

  Functions
    These are exported on demand or may be called fully qualified

    recent $time
    recent $time, $test_description
    recent $time, $duration, $test_description
        Tests (using the Test::Builder framework) if the time occured within
        the duration ago from the current time. If no duration is passed,
        ten seconds is assumed.

    occured_within_ago $time, $duration
        Returns true if and only if the time occured within the duration ago
        from the current time.
