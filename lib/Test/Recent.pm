=head1 NAME

Test::Recent - check a time is recent

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Test::More;
   use Test::Recent qw(recent);

   # check things happened in the last ten seconds
   recent DateTime->now, "now is recent!";
   recent "2012-12-23 00:00:00", "end of mayan calendar happened recently?";

   # check things happened in the last hour
   recent "2012-12-23 00:00:00", DateTime::Duration->new( hours => 1 ), "mayan";
   recent "2012-12-23 00:00:00", "1 hour", "mayan"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Simple module to check things happened recently.

=head2 Functions

These are exported on demand or may be called fully qualified

=over

=item recent $date_and_time

=item recent $date_and_time, $test_description

=item recent $date_and_time, $duration, $test_description

Tests (using the Test::Builder framework) if the time occurred within the
duration ago from the current time.  If no duration is passed, ten seconds
is assumed.

=item occured_within_ago $date_and_time, $duration

Returns true if and only if the time occurred within the duration ago from
the current time.

=back

=head2 Parsing of DateTimes

This module supports the following things being passed in as a date and time:

=over

=item A DateTime object

=item An ISO8601 formatted date string

i.e. anything that DateTime::Format::ISO8601 can parse

=item A Postgres style TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE 

i.e. something of the form C<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ssssss+TZ>

=back

Older versions of this module used DateTimeX::Easy to parse the datetime, but
this proved to be unreliable.

Bugs should be reported via this distribution's

In order not to depend on another DateTime library, this module converts
postgres style TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE by using a regular expression and
simply ignoring microseconds.  This potentially introduces a one second
inaccuracy in the recent handling.
